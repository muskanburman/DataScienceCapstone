# DataScienceCapstone
Course work done as a part of the Data Science Capstone Course 

The course is meant to be a largely independent empirical project which makes 
concrete use of all aspects of data science explored in the core and possibly in 
domain course, from identifying a data source, cleaning and organizing the data, 
conducting appropriate statistical analysis, to interpreting and reporting the 
results of the study in a standard scholarly form. 

Students will have to demonstrate skills learned in DS certificate classes such as 
data wrangling, statistical data analysis including application of machine learning 
methods and database management skills, plotting and visualization as well as 
telling the story with the data.

Expected Work: The class will meet several times during the semester, for 80 
minutes.  We will provide you with one or two data sets to select from. You may 
also submit a data set which you want to work on subject to the instructor 
approval. This meetings will correspond to the Checkpoints for the project and 
students will have to give presentations which reflect their progress with respect 
to the given checkpoint.   
Here is the list of checkpoints:
Checkpoint 1:   Data Cleaning. Provided data sets will need to be 
cleaned  - to be importable to R studio or SQL workbench. Data will be in csv 
format but may need some pre-processing.  You will have to show us that data 
can be imported to say R studio, plus make a presentation plus code which you 
used for data cleaning. 
Checkpoint 2:   Tell us about the data in the language of plots, tables, 
statistics, aggregations.  Any interesting plots you canâ€™t wait to share with the 
class?   Distributions of variables?  Correlations?  What are the key features? 
Which attributes/features/variables you would like to ignore?  
Most importantly: What would you like to do? What is the actionable information 
which you would like to infer from your data and why would it be actionable and 
valuable?  Who is your client or audience?  Plan, plan, plan.....Convince us, make 
us anticipate eagerly your final presentation.  
What hypotheses would you like to test?  What prediction models you want to 
build? 
Checkpoint 3:   
This is the final presentation 1.0. What did you come up with? Why is it 
interesting and actionable?  What statistical tools have you used to back your 
results up. Any p-values?  Prediction model evaluation (errors, cross validations 
etc). We will discuss and give you detailed feedback. This may be done as 
sequence of 1-1 meetings with instructor and TA or as whole class meeting (we 
have less than 10 students so it is a very small class). 

This is the time for your final presentation after incorporating the feedback you received 
at the checkpoint 3. 
Prepare the final report in the form of data driven blog entry, i.e. short article about your 
conclusions with the nice data driven story telling.
